### Understanding Scan Results

PowerSweep provides results in three main sections:

1. Network Discovery Output: Lists all discovered hosts with:
   - IP Address
   - Hostname (if available)
   - Device type
   - Response time

2. Results Summary: Overview of findings including:
   - Device types detected
   - Common services found
   - Hosts with open shares

3. Vulnerability Assessment (if enabled): Security analysis including:
   - Potentially insecure protocols
   - Exposed services
   - Security recommendations

### Example Usage Scenarios

Quick Network Survey:
# Default settings will scan your local subnet
.\PowerSweep.ps1
# Press S to start scanning

Scan Specific IP Range:
.\PowerSweep.ps1
# Select option 1, then Y to use custom range
# Enter start IP: 192.168.1.1
# Enter end IP: 192.168.1.50
# Press S to start scanning

Security Audit with Export:
.\PowerSweep.ps1
# Ensure options 4, 5, 6 (ports, shares, vulnerabilities) are enabled
# Set option 7 (Export) to True
# Press S to start the scan
# Results will be saved to the specified path

## üìä Understanding the Output

### Device Type Detection

PowerSweep uses multiple techniques to determine device types:

- Port patterns: Identifies common service combinations (e.g., ports 80+443 indicate a web server)
- Hostname analysis: Checks for keywords that indicate device function
- Service fingerprinting: Examines open services to determine OS and device role

### Vulnerability Assessment

The vulnerability scan checks for:

- Insecure protocols: FTP, Telnet, unencrypted HTTP
- Exposed services: RDP, database servers, VNC
- Network shares: Open, potentially unsecured file shares
- Missing encryption: Services that should use encryption but don't

Each finding includes:
- Severity rating (High, Medium, Low)
- Description of the issue
- Specific recommendation to address the vulnerability

### Color Coding

PowerSweep uses color to help identify important information:

- Green: IP addresses, successful operations
- Red: High severity issues, errors
- Yellow: Medium severity issues, warnings
- Cyan: System information, headings
- Magenta: Network devices, section titles
- Blue: Windows systems
- White: General information

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Custom Port Scanning

PowerSweep scans common ports by default (21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 88, 110, 123, 135, 139, 143, 389, 443, 445, 465, 587, 636, 993, 995, 1433, 1434, 3306, 3389, 5900, 8080).

### Directory Creation for Exports

When exporting results, PowerSweep automatically checks if the target directory exists and creates it if necessary.

### Thread Management

Adjust the thread count based on your system's capabilities:
- Higher thread counts = faster scanning but more resource usage
- Lower thread counts = slower scanning but less system impact

## üîç Script Components

The script consists of several key functions:

1. Get-LocalNetworkInfo: Gathers and displays information about the local network interfaces and calculates network range information.

2. Test-Port: Tests if a specific port is open on a given IP address.

3. Scan-Network: The main scanning function that:
   - Converts IP range to integers for enumeration
   - Creates a thread pool for parallel processing
   - Scans IP addresses for active hosts
   - Identifies open ports and services
   - Discovers shares on Windows devices
   - Determines device types

4. Scan-Vulnerabilities: Analyzes results for security issues and provides recommendations.

5. Show-ResultSummary: Summarizes findings in an easy-to-read format.

6. Show-Menu: Provides the user interface for configuring and starting scans.

## üîí Security Note

This tool is intended for legitimate network administration and security assessment. Always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning networks that you don't own or manage.

## ‚úÖ Troubleshooting

- CSV Export Issues: If you encounter problems exporting to the Desktop, the script will offer to save to Documents instead.
- MAC Address Detection: Requires admin privileges; will show as "Unknown" otherwise.
- Share Discovery: May not work on non-Windows devices or without proper authentication.
- "Failed to enumerate" Messages: Usually indicates the host has firewalls blocking the scan; this is normal.

# PowerSweep Lite

PowerSweep Lite is a minimal, lightweight network scanner for quickly discovering devices on your network. It focuses solely on finding active hosts without any of the advanced features of the full PowerSweep tool.

## Features

- **Basic Device Identification**: Identifies common device types based on hostname patterns
- **Multithreaded Scanning**: Fast parallel processing for quick results
- **Clean Visual Interface**: Colorful, easy-to-read console output
- **Direct Result Display**: Shows results in a simple table format

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Administrator privileges recommended (for MAC address detection)

## Installation & Usage

1. Download the PowerSweep-Lite.ps1 file
2. Run PowerShell as Administrator (recommended)
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script
4. Execute: `.\PowerSweep-Lite.ps1`

PowerSweep Lite has a simple menu with just three options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1. IP Range | Set the range of IP addresses to scan |
| 2. Timeout | Adjust connection timeout (100-5000ms) |
| 3. Thread Count | Set number of concurrent threads (1-100) |

Press S to start the scan, or Q to quit.

## Output Information

The scan results display the following information:
- IP Address
- Hostname (when available)
- Device Type
- Response Time (ping latency)
- MAC Address (requires admin privileges)

## Key Differences from PowerSweep Full

- **Focused Functionality**: Only performs basic network discovery
- **No Port Scanning**: Doesn't scan for open ports
- **No Share Discovery**: Doesn't attempt to discover network shares
- **No Vulnerability Assessment**: No security checks performed
- **No Export Functionality**: Results are displayed directly in the console
- **Simplified Menu**: Only includes essential options
